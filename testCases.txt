Manual (inputting username: ‘admin’, password: ‘admin123” would redirect you to admin/admin123/dashboard) (test completed)
Manual (pressing on nav button on main-page should navigate you to the next reference point) test completed. 
Unit testing (get length of current amount number of drinks(state), use addToAll() function, and then check length of current num of drinks again (state))
Unit testing (searching for specific location, changing name that location to another name, and then searching for that location again)
problem: had no idea how to test with react context, also I think because next already pre-configured babel in some way, you have to arrange babel in specific way
